# Ract Test
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

and

### `npm start`

to run the project

Everything was done as described on the pdf with one small change.
Instead of using react select library - https://react-select.com/home.
I used Material ui to render the same component. Other than that everything is the same.
